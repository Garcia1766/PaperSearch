{"id": 0, "title": "Learning Discrete Representations via Constrained Clustering for Effective and Efficient Dense Retrieval", "abstract": "Dense Retrieval (DR) has achieved state-of-the-art first-stage ranking effectiveness. However, the efficiency of most existing DR models is limited by the large memory cost of storing dense vectors and the time-consuming nearest neighbor search (NNS) in vector space. Therefore, we present RepCONC, a novel retrieval model that learns discrete Representations via CONstrained Clustering. RepCONC jointly trains dual-encoders and the Product Quantization (PQ) method to learn discrete document representations and enables fast approximate NNS with compact indexes. It models quantization as a constrained clustering process, which requires the document embeddings to be uniformly clustered around the quantization centroids and supports end-to-end optimization of the quantization method and dual-encoders. We theoretically demonstrate the importance of the uniform clustering constraint in RepCONC and derive an efficient approximate solution for constrained clustering by reducing it to an instance of the optimal transport problem. Besides constrained clustering, RepCONC further adopts a vector-based inverted file system (IVF) to support highly efficient vector search on CPUs. Extensive experiments on two popular ad-hoc retrieval benchmarks show that RepCONC achieves better ranking effectiveness than competitive vector quantization baselines under different compression ratio settings. It also substantially outperforms a wide range of existing retrieval models in terms of retrieval effectiveness, memory efficiency, and time efficiency.", "author": ["Jingtao Zhan", "Jiaxin Mao", "Yiqun Liu"]}
{"id": 1, "title":"Interpreting Dense Retrieval as Mixture of Topics", "abstract":"Dense Retrieval (DR) reaches state-of-the-art results in first-stage retrieval, but little is known about the mechanisms that contribute to its success. Therefore, in this work, we conduct an interpretation study of recently proposed DR models. Specifically, we first discretize the embeddings output by the document and query encoders. Based on the discrete representations, we analyze the attribution of input tokens. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments are carried out on public test collections. Results suggest that DR models pay attention to different aspects of input and extract various high-level topic representations. Therefore, we can regard the representations learned by DR models as a mixture of high-level topics.", "author":["Jingtao Zhan", "Jiaxin Mao", "Yiqun Liu"]}
